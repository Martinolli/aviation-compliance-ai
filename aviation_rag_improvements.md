# Aviation Compliance AI RAG Project: Improvement Recommendations

## 1. Architecture and Code Structure Improvements

### 1.1 Modularization and Code Organization
- **Current State**: The project mixes Python and JavaScript files with some overlapping functionality. The file structure is not clearly organized by component type.
- **Recommendation**: Reorganize the codebase into a more modular structure:
  ```
  /aviation-rag/
    /src/
      /core/         # Core RAG functionality
      /data/         # Data processing and management
      /embeddings/   # Embedding generation and management
      /retrieval/    # Vector search and retrieval
      /ui/           # User interface components
      /utils/        # Utility functions
    /config/         # Configuration files
    /scripts/        # Standalone scripts
    /tests/          # Unit and integration tests
  ```

### 1.2 Dependency Management
