  - Preconditions for Unsafe Acts (environmental factors, personnel factors)
  - Unsafe Supervision (inadequate supervision, planned inappropriate operations)
  - Organizational Influences (resource management, organizational climate)

### 2. Dirty Dozen Framework
- **Current State**: Limited human error analysis
- **Recommendation**: Integrate the "Dirty Dozen" human factors framework:
  - Lack of communication
  - Complacency
  - Lack of knowledge
  - Distraction
  - Lack of teamwork
  - Fatigue
  - Lack of resources
  - Pressure
  - Lack of assertiveness
  - Stress
  - Lack of awareness
  - Norms

### 3. Just Culture Implementation
- **Current State**: No specific error management culture framework
- **Recommendation**: Implement Just Culture principles:
  - Error classification (human error, at-risk behavior, reckless behavior)
  - Accountability framework
  - Learning system implementation
  - Reporting culture enhancement

## Operational Compliance Analysis

### 1. Compliance Verification Program
- **Current State**: General compliance concepts
- **Recommendation**: Implement structured compliance verification:
  - Compliance checklist generation based on applicable regulations
  - Gap analysis methodology
  - Compliance monitoring program templates
  - Audit finding categorization and tracking

### 2. Certificate Management
- **Current State**: No specific certificate tracking
- **Recommendation**: Implement certificate management:
  - Air Operator Certificate (AOC) requirements tracking
  - Maintenance organization approval requirements
  - Design organization approval requirements
  - Personnel licensing requirements

### 3. Special Approvals Analysis
- **Current State**: No specific operational approval tracking
- **Recommendation**: Implement special approvals analysis:
  - RVSM (Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum)
  - ETOPS/EDTO (Extended Operations)
  - LVO (Low Visibility Operations)
  - PBN (Performance-Based Navigation)
  - EFB (Electronic Flight Bag)
  - MNPS (Minimum Navigation Performance Specification)

## Technical Operations Enhancement

### 1. Airworthiness Directive Analysis
- **Current State**: No specific AD tracking
- **Recommendation**: Implement AD management:
  - AD applicability determination
  - Compliance method analysis
  - Alternative method of compliance (AMOC) evaluation
  - AD compliance tracking

### 2. Maintenance Program Optimization
- **Current State**: Basic maintenance concepts
- **Recommendation**: Implement maintenance program analysis:
  - Maintenance task interval optimization
  - Reliability program integration
  - MSG-3 analysis methodology
  - Maintenance effectiveness evaluation

### 3. Configuration Management
- **Current State**: No specific configuration tracking
- **Recommendation**: Implement configuration management:
  - Aircraft modification status tracking
  - STC (Supplemental Type Certificate) management
  - Equipment qualification status
  - MEL (Minimum Equipment List) management

## Aviation-Specific Knowledge Enhancement

### 1. Aviation Taxonomy Integration
- **Current State**: General aviation terminology
- **Recommendation**: Implement comprehensive aviation taxonomies:
  - ICAO ADREP taxonomy for occurrence classification
  - Aircraft component taxonomy (ATA chapters)
  - Airport facility codes and designators
  - Standard aviation abbreviations and acronyms

### 2. Aviation Document Types
- **Current State**: Basic document processing without aviation-specific types
- **Recommendation**: Implement aviation document type recognition:
  - Operations manuals (OM-A, OM-B, OM-C, OM-D)
  - Maintenance manuals (AMM, IPC, CMM)
  - Flight manuals (AFM, FCOM, QRH)
  - Technical records (tech logs, journey logs)

### 3. Aviation Standards Integration
- **Current State**: Limited standards knowledge
- **Recommendation**: Integrate industry standards:
  - RTCA/DO documents (e.g., DO-178C, DO-254)
  - SAE standards (e.g., ARP4754A, ARP4761)
  - ARINC specifications
  - Military standards (MIL-STD)
